# Project-Three
Project Three was basically using what was learned of using both C++ on combination with Python in order to develop a working code. Using that to calculate different things given a number of items depending on the fucntion. Whether that be showing how many times a certain item appears or the frequency of a specific item we were supposed to use the culmination of gained knowledge while wokring on the course to create the code from basically scratch. Save for the starter code found in the text documents given to us to start us off.
I think the thing I did articularly well was the creation of each function using Python in order to get the desired outcome. I mean overall I think if I learned more over time whether it be years from now of whatever all areas of my code could be improved. Since this is starter code based off a short amount od time of c++ study there are probably a lot of areas that are needlessly cumbersome for no reason. The most challenging thing wasnt the code itself but was the weird problems I ran into while trying to implement Python. It weird how getting Visual Studio to work took a lot of effort. Though that is probably because I didnt use the virtual machaine version. I thnk the way I made the program better in readability is from the inserting comments. Also generally all skills and practive I got from doing this would be useful in any other programming setting I go into.
